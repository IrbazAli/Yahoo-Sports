<p style="font-size:14px">When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cricket.com/players/rishabh-pant-65756" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Rishabh Pant</a>&nbsp;scored a century in the first innings of the<a href="https://www.cricket.com/live-score/england-vs-india-1st-test-india-tour-of-england-2025-250825/scorecard" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;first Test against England at Headingley</a>, one thought it could not get better than that. However, the India wicketkeeper has managed to outdo himself as he has followed that up with another century in the second innings.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Before Pant, Andy Flower was the only wicketkeeper who had scored twin centuries in a Test. He scored 142 and 199* against South Africa in Harare all the way back in 1999.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">In the first innings, Pant became the second Indian wicketkeeper after MS Dhoni to score 3,000 runs. Pant now has eight Test tons &#8211; the most for India. This is also his fourth century in England.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:14px">Pant slammed 134 in the first innings and put on 209 for the fourth wicket with Shubman Gill, who also slammed a century as India went on to score 471. He then brought up his second hundred of the match off 130 deliveries, making him the first Indian to score twin tons in England.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-206be174 alignfull uagb-is-root-container"><div class="uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KL Rahul feels no matter how well he prepares, there’s no guaranteed success in Test cricket</h2>



<p style="font-size:14px"><a href="https://www.cricket.com/players/kl-rahul-60122" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">KL Rahul</a>&nbsp;has featured in 59 Tests and has played a lot of match-saving and match-winning knocks, but still averages less than 35. The right-handed batter from Karnataka has played enough red-ball cricket to understand no matter how well he prepares, there’s no guaranteed success in Test cricket.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px"><a href="https://www.cricket.com/live-score/england-vs-india-1st-test-india-tour-of-england-2025-250825/commentary" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">In the first Test against England at Headingley</a>, Rahul scored an eye-pleasing 42 off 78 in the first innings and followed it up with a stunning 247-ball 137 in the second essay. Rahul put on 195 runs for the fourth wicket alongside Rishabh Pant (118) and helped India set England a target of 371 in the final innings.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">&#8220;The sooner you learn that there is no connection (of your game, preparation etc) with the outcome and the results that you get, the calmer you can be. And I feel like that&#8217;s the only thing that gives you the best chance to play at this level for a long period of time. And that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve consciously done as well,” said Rahul, as reported by ESPNcricinfo.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">&#8220;Having learned this from the seniors that I looked up to, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve understood and try and do, not just in Test cricket, but in cricket overall. Just all you can do is your best in terms of preparation and giving yourself the best chance to succeed. But again, there&#8217;s no guarantees. When you have a good day, you are happy. When you have a bad day, you&#8217;re still happy that you had the opportunity. That&#8217;s how I look at the game.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Rahul often starts the series with a couple of solid knocks but fails to keep his form going throughout the series. Even in Australia, Rahul played three good knocks in the first three games but ended the series with scores of 0, 24, 13 and 4. It’s one of the key reasons why he has never had a 400-plus series in red-ball cricket for India.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">&#8220;I was happy with the way I was batting in Australia, but very disappointed at the end of the series that I couldn&#8217;t convert. I think I had opportunities in every game, I got starts in every game, and in an ideal world, I would&#8217;ve wanted to convert all of those innings into big knocks.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">&#8220;But unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t do that. And that&#8217;s how the game goes sometimes. Sometimes you get a good ball, sometimes you play a bad shot. It&#8217;s part of the game, so you learn from the mistakes, and that&#8217;s something that I learned from that series, just to make sure that once I get a start, try and make it count and transfer as many runs as I can.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Talking about not having a fixed batting position before this series, the 33-year-old said: &#8220;The last couple of years I&#8217;ve forgotten what my position is and what I&#8217;m comfortable doing. I&#8217;m happy to be given different responsibilities and different roles. Makes the game exciting and makes me want to challenge myself and train that much harder and work on my game a little bit more. So I&#8217;ve quite enjoyed doing that.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">&#8220;And the last couple of series, my role has been to open the batting, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed doing that as well. Yeah, I mean that&#8217;s something that I did growing up and all my early years as a cricketer was me opening the batting. So yeah, I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;m back doing that, and I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;m doing the job for the team.&#8221;</p>

<div class="wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-4aa6172c alignfull uagb-is-root-container"><div class="uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">England, chasing a target of 371, were 21 for no loss at the end of day four. They require 350 more runs, while India need 10 wickets</h2>



<p style="font-size:14px">More than 1300 runs have been scored in the first four days of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cricket.com/live-score/england-vs-india-1st-test-india-tour-of-england-2025-250825/commentary" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the opening Test between England and India at Headingley</a>, but we still don’t have a guaranteed winner. England, chasing a target of 371, were 21 for no loss at the end of day four. They require 350 more runs, while India need 10 wickets. Given the way England have been playing Test cricket of late, they will surely go for the target, which will also keep the visitors in the game.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">However, everything will depend on how the Leeds surface behaves on the final day of the Test. “I think the first two days, being as hot as they were, the pitch has taken a bit of a beating. The crack seems like it’s opening up. There’s a bit of rough there, and the wicket is really dry. Mostly, it’s like a subcontinent wicket on day five,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cricket.com/players/kl-rahul-60122" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">KL Rahul</a>&nbsp;told Jiostar, as reported by ESPNcricinfo.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">“Day five wickets won’t be as easy, but knowing the way England play and their style of cricket, they’re going to come hard and try to score boundaries and quick runs. We need to keep that in the back of our minds, bowl as straight as we can, be patient, and not give them those boundaries — make them earn their runs. It should be a very interesting day.”</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Rahul and Rishabh Pant both scored centuries on day four but struggled to score freely in the first session. “It was very different this morning. It almost felt like it was the first time we were actually in English conditions. The ball was seaming around, it was overcast, and there was a bit happening off the wicket.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">“The first couple of days when we batted, there wasn’t much. There was a bit of swing in the air, but nothing off the pitch. But this morning, it was a really good spell. I just felt like I needed to play tighter, make sure that we didn’t lose too many wickets, and make sure that I killed the first session. I was trying to play as straight as possible — at least defend as straight as possible.”</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Rahul made 137 off 247 deliveries, while Pant smashed 118 off 140 deliveries. The two put on 195 runs for the fourth wicket and helped India set England a formidable target. “When Rishabh walks in, you just let him be,” Rahul added.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">“He knows what’s best for the team and for himself and how he can do that. Everyone’s different. Rishabh is a very different player. He does the job for the team, so you just let him be and make sure that he’s doing the simple things right. We’ve had a few partnerships before as well, so we enjoy batting together.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The India opener smashed his third century in England &#8211; the most by an Indian opener</h2>



<p style="font-size:14px"><a href="https://www.cricket.com/players/kl-rahul-60122" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">KL Rahul</a>&nbsp;in England is a tale of two halves. In his first tour of 2018, Rahul struggled to cope with the movement and more often than not, went back to the pavillion early. However, things changed in the first Test of that tour, when an assured Rahul looked set to get a big one, but it was in the second innings that he really showed his prowess, slamming 149 in the fourth innings at The Oval.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">From that Test to now, Rahul has slammed over 600 runs at 55, which include two tons and two fifties.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size:14px">His century<a href="https://www.cricket.com/live-score/england-vs-india-1st-test-india-tour-of-england-2025-250825/commentary" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;at Headingley&nbsp;</a>has further established that he is right up there among the best openers in the world, at least when it comes to England, for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Most centuries by an Indian opener in England</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:15px"><em>3 &#8211; KL Rahul</em></p>



<p style="font-size:15px">2 &#8211; Rahul Dravid</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">2 &#8211; Sunil Gavaskar</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">2- Vijay Merchant</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">2 &#8211; Ravi Shastri</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">For someone who slammed a century in his debut Test series in Australia, coping with the conditions in England proved to be a challenge. However, since that ton at The Oval, he has turned a corner. His leaving has improved and more importantly, his shot selection has been a little more sensible.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Despite playing alongside extravagant stroke-makers like Rishabh Pant and even at times Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rahul has not tried to match them shot for shot, and in his own way has brought a sense of calm to the batting line-up.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">He is no stranger to donning new roles, as he has done so efficiently in One-Day Internationals (ODI), and even in Tests at times, batting up and down the order. However, in England, he has been India&#8217;s designated opener for some time. Be it opening with Shikhar Dhawan, Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma or now Jaiswal, Rahul has been a constant.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Most 50+ scores for an India opener in SENA countries</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:15px">19 &#8211; Sunil Gavaskar (57 inns)</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">9* &#8211; KL Rahul (42 inns)</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">9 &#8211; Virender Sehwag (49 inns)</p>



<p style="font-size:15px">9 &#8211; Murali Vijay (42 inns)</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">In the ongoing Test at Headingley, the pitch has not deteriorated much over the four days, and Rahul, as a result, has left the ball on line. Anything outside off, Rahul is happy to leave it. For someone who likes to play inside the line of the ball, leaving the ball outside off is a trait that perhaps comes naturally.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">Not to forget, in between all this, his drives through the covers have been a treat to the eyes. His balance and his follow-through have certainly stood out.</p>



<p style="font-size:14px">India are entering a new era under Shubman Gill, and Rahul has stamped his authority early. With no Virat Kohli or Rohit, Rahul will have to shoulder the responsibility of being one of the most experienced players in the side. India would hope that the Karnataka batter goes from strength to strength from here.</p>
